- 👋 Welcome Friend! This is the official github for thefriendlymanual.com project. I am Jim, the project founder and benevolent dictator for life of thefriendlymanual.com
- 👀 If you love Open Source Software, check out our list of Useful Free Open Source Software along with the occasional article or tutorial at https://thefriendlymanual.com
- 💞️ This Github is planned to be used for (hopefully) useful information related to content and projects that interest me. That will probably mean Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, tutorials and hopefully at least one one actual Friendly Manual Open Ebook at some point.
- 📫 For now, you can reach me at github@thefriendlymanual.com
- 😄 Keep Calm and Read The Friendly Manual.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The F in RTFM stands for Friendly. Trust me on this, I would never lie to you about something so important.
